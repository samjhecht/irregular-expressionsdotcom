<div class="poem-wrapper">
  I’ve suffered a loss<br>
  A death in the family. <br>
  As is so often the case,<br>
  I know I had known this day would come,<br>
  Eventually.  Ugh. <br>
  Now that it’s here it’s time to reflect <br>
  on the time spent together. <br>
  Good times.  <br>
  Passionate times. <br>
  Usually motivating. <br>
  Sometimes, soul crushing -<br>
  Discouragement intertwined with intense longing. <br>
  Always intoxicating.  <br>
  <br>
  For all of those days,<br>
  I’ll forever be grateful,<br>
  Albeit always a little ashamed<br>
  That I didn’t make better use of the time we had. <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at these final years<br>
  And the weeks leading up to the end<br>
  There is some peace to temper the mourning. <br>
  I guess it’s solace in knowing <br>
  the day I’d always secretly feared<br>
  Has finally come. <br>
  The weight of keeping a secret from oneself<br>
  is a burden hard to bear. <br>
  <br>
  So here I lift my silence<br>
  And like so many before<br>
  Admit that I am mortal<br>
  and that, recently,<br>
  my youth slipped, silently,<br>
  Out the back door <br>
  While I slept, cluelessly. <br>
  I’ll try to be accepting. <br>
  To make the best despite knowing<br>
  The best is not yet to come. <br>
  <br>
  I’ve suffered a loss. <br>
  A death in the family. <br>
  A dream held so dearly<br>
  Has faded in the face of forever. <br>
  And from this day forward<br>
  I’ll be just another aging man<br>
  With only the dreams, dearly held,<br>
  Of memories that might have been. <br>
