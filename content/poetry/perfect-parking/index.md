<div class="poem-wrapper">
    They’re building more apartments. <br>
    Ugly ones. <br>
    184 of them. <br>
    With only sixty parking spots.  <br>
    Who approves such lopsided lapses in judgement?<br>
    <br>
    On the other hand,<br>
    Parking spots may soon be obsolete. <br>
    When the mad march of manly progress<br>
    Brings a silent swarm of slave chauffeurs. <br>
    <br>
    But what about me?<br>
    Am I ready to give it up?  <br>
    The freedom to just drive?<br>
    The speed and the control?<br>
    All my life I’ve lived in the knowing<br>
    That I’m more likely to die <br>
    Driving to the airport <br>
    Than from the plane going down.  <br>
    It never gave me pause. <br>
    The risk being less than the reward.<br>
    And the journey made a hint <br>
    more alive <br>
    For a wild one like me. <br>
    <br>
    Alas! Oh well!<br>
    I guess I’ll have to now. <br>
    Let’s resort to new drugs!<br>
    Perhaps more potent pills. <br>
    For we’ll soon be plum out<br>
    of perfect places to park. <br>
