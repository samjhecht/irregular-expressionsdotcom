<div class="poem-wrapper">
    I finally found what I stand for<br>
    And I can't stand by. <br>
    Not tonight, at least. <br>
    Not when, finally,<br>
    there's a fight to be fought. <br>
    I have no shortage of words and,<br>
    In some sets of circumstances, that's a good thing. <br>
    But not tonight, I'm afraid. <br>
    Not when, after all,<br>
    So much has been said by so many. <br>
    I have doubts in my own limited ability,<br>
    There's no doubt about that. <br>
    Especially when so many have failed. <br>
    And so many will fight no longer. <br>
    Not tonight, maybe never. <br>
    But with that in mind, <br>
    and with all due respect,<br>
    I'll finally speak my mind. <br>
    Of the few things I believe<br>
    And the even fewer that I know to be true,<br>
    There is one thought that I am inclined to share. <br>
    One mustn't be afraid <br>
    to live a life of consequence. <br>
    Not tonight.<br>
