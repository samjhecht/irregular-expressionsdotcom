<div class="poem-wrapper">
  Just one week 📅 <br>
  Seven measly days<br>
  over in the blink of an eye 👁 <br>
  But oh how I know<br>
  And you should beware:<br>
  For every seven days<br>
  Seven measly days<br>
  There’s always six lurking nights <br>
  Six long lonely nights. <br>
  They might be nothing<br>
  Or they could just be a dream <br>
  They could be six parties 🎉 <br>
  But they could be a prison<br>
  With bars of sunshine 🌞 <br>
  Where the hours stretch like melting wax <br>
  And time plays her wicked tricks<br>
  On the mind of a man. <br>
