<div class="poem-wrapper">
  I feel like dropping off the side of the earth. <br>
  Into the crack between the bed and the wall. <br>
  To tumble into darkness<br>
  To not know up from down<br>
  And to not even care <br>
  just how far I fall. <br>
  Until, at last, I find<br>
  my wonderland after allâ€¦<br>
</div>
