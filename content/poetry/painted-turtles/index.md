<div class="poem-wrapper">
  Remember that time?<br>
  We painted stripes on a turtle. <br>
  You had gum in your hair<br>
  You wouldn’t let me cut it out<br>
  You were always that way. <br>
  You never let me cut your hair. <br>
  But you let me love you.<br>
  It’s strange to say,<br>
  But so happy all the same.<br>
  I remember how we lay there.<br>
  Or is it lie?<br>
  Let’s say that we lay<br>
  there was no lying with us,<br>
  Just laying and being honest<br>
  With each other and the world. <br>
  We weren’t rich <br>
  we weren’t poor. <br>
  We had enough <br>
  But we always wanted more. <br>
  I think that’s how it often is. <br>
  Not to say we aren’t unique,  <br>
  I doubt there’s ever been a pair  <br>
  That painted turtles with gum in their hair.  <br>
