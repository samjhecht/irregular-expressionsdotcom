<div class="poem-wrapper">
    We came to an end<br>
    a few weeks ago<br>
    and I don't think that either was hurt.<br>
    But a friend of ours told me<br>
    that, when all was said and done,<br>
    you told her the root of the cause.<br>
    Your trepidation,<br>
    or reservation,<br>
    was not due to my looks.<br>
    but instead you took pause<br>
    when I said one of my flaws<br>
    is that I eat like a baby bird!<br>
    Oh how funny!, I thought.<br>
    It just goes to show!<br>
    How it's so hard to know<br>
    what moves the mind of a lover.<br>
    and who would have thought<br>
    that I would lose my shot<br>
    from that singular avian quality!?<br>
