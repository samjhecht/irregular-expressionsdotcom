<div class="poem-wrapper">
  The sun that’s always just about to set<br>
  The fog just can’t bring itself to lift<br>
  A cold, wet mist across a field like a soft, dry  blanket.  <br>
  The wind that whispers warmly as though the storms aren’t on their way. <br>
  What keeps us?  Why linger?<br>
  Why is it so hard to look away?<br>
  And to think!<br>
  I’d have never known how beautiful a sunset it really was. <br>
  If I hadn’t turned around to watch it glowing across your face. <br>
