<div class="poem-wrapper">
  I went out to smoke a cigarette <br>
  That’s the measure of tonight. <br>
  That old pack. The one in the cabinet. <br>
  The one that I keep. No. Not for me!<br>
  The one just in case I need to be a good host. <br>
  Damn. It felt good. <br>
  <br>
  It reminds me of Cuba. Of Havana. <br>
  Of breaking the rules. <br>
  Of being in love. With everyone around me. <br>
  <br>
  I’m having another. <br>
  This is an unusual night. <br>
  So what if I have a death wish?<br>
  There could be worse fates<br>
  Than to wish a wish that you can be sure will come true. <br>
  <br>
  But don’t worry<br>
  I don’t really want to die. <br>
  Not tonight, anyway. <br>
  I’ve got much left to do!<br>
  Poems to write. <br>
  Mountains to climb. <br>
  And a whole bowl of fresh peaches. <br>
