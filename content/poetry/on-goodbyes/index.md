<div class="poem-wrapper">
  I only lied to you<br>
  Because you put me in a situation. <br>
  You know how I hate goodbyes. <br>
  I hope my last words are worth a damn.<br>
  The last goodbye I ever say<br>
  Will have meant something<br>
  Because I'll have made sure<br>
  to prove my point. <br>
