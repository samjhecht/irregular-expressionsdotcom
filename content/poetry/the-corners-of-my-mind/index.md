<div class="poem-wrapper">
  I got your message<br>
  Coming down at the speed of sound. <br>
  To that I send my reply. <br>
  And I'll have to disagree. <br>
  Minds don't have pages. <br>
  But they do have corners. <br>
  Oh I believe and have seen<br>
  How dark they can be. <br>
  The corners of my mind. <br>
