<div class="poem-wrapper">
  Just seeing you there was hard.<br>
  You were so helpless.<br>
  You looked bad. Even in a room full of San franciscos sickest.<br>
  Your lung was collapsed.<br>
  Your stomach was perforated.<br>
  They had to do surgery.<br>
  Now there you were. Laying there. Barely alive.<br>
  You had a chest tube.<br>
  And a feeding tube.<br>
  And a ventilator tube.<br>
  And a catheter tube.<br>
  And an IV tube.<br>
  I'm glad you're sedated.<br>
  Because a man shouldn't have to see himself with so many tubes.<br>
  You couldn't talk. Or even open your eyes.<br>
  I tried to talk to you. You squeezed my hand.<br>
  I think you heard me.<br>
  But I can't be sure.<br>
  I keep coming back. Day after day.<br>
  I want to be there when you wake up.<br>
  I want you to see a familiar face.<br>
  We were never very close.<br>
  By the looks of it we never will be.<br>
  But I think you should see a familiar face when you wake up.<br>
  It's strange. Seeing you like this.<br>
  We don't know each other well.<br>
  But I can see that we have the same hands.<br>
  Whether there's more in common I cannot say.<br>
  There's not really enough left anymore. And there's just so many tubes.<br>
  But, as it turns out, the hands are enough.<br>
  Just seeing my own hands like that.  <br>
  I can't help but be transported to my own death bed.<br>
  You can't speak, so we don't talk.<br>
  But in this silence I find I experience more than we could have covered in dialogue.<br>
  And in the silence i can hear the moments ticking away. And there are just so few.<br>
  Just looking there.  At those hands. My hands. <br>
  I am mortal. I am mortal.<br>
  But this shouldn't be about me.<br>
  I want to be here for you.  Even if we don't really know each other very well.<br>
  They say you had cocaine in your system when they brought you in.<br>
  Could that be me one day?<br>
  the presence of drugs was the crutch others were looking for.<br>
  Now they don't have to feel bad.<br>
  It's not their fault you chose to throw your life away.<br>
  That you've thrown it down the tube.<br>
  But somehow that's not how I feel.<br>
  Our minds are out to get us.<br>
  That much I know.<br>
  Yours must have been strong.<br>
  A force to be reckoned with.<br>
  How painful it must have been.  All these years.<br>
  And the pain begets pain.<br>
  It was hard seeing you there.<br>
  So sick and so desperate.<br>
  And with so many tubes.<br>
  And those hands.<br>
