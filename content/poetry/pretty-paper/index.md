<div class="poem-wrapper">
Pretty paper thin<br>
A veil, and nothing more. <br>
Enjoy it while you’re here,<br>
It won’t be long before<br>
The veil Is ripped away<br>
The night dissolves the day,<br>
And though you will the sun to rise<br>
And you row and row against the tide<br>
The current is much too strong.<br>
Dear friend!  There'll soon be nowhere left to hide!<br>
