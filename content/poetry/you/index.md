<div class="poem-wrapper">
    I've met with success<br>
    but it's failure I know.<br>
    I woke up this morning<br>
    a powerful ache in my head.<br>
    Then in my stomach I felt that feeling of dread.<br>
    I prayed for a moment<br>
    That it had all been a dark twisted dream<br>
    That you still loved me<br>
    That things weren't as bad as they seemed.<br>
    I've tried to deny it, but I know that it's true<br>
    the worst thing that could happen to me,<br>
    Is the best thing that could happen to you.<br>
