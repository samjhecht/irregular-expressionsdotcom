<div class="poem-wrapper">
Is there such a thing as too picky?</br>
What’s so wrong about knowing exactly what I want?</br>
All I really want is to meet someone </br>
and not even realize what I’m getting into.  </br>
To be so love drunk </br>
that I probably shouldn’t be driving.  </br>
To feel the whirlwind</br>
as it flows through what’s left of my hair. </br>
Then to wake up one day </br>
and finally realize</br>
that I’ve fallen head over heels in love.  </br>
That I’ve been seeing the world</br>
under the influence of a spell (but in a good way). </br>
Then to sit down at my desk </br>
and find out that you’ve inspired me </br>
to write the next great American novel. </br>
Then the two of us will live out our days </br>
sharing a charmed life</br>
of growing fame and bohemian parties. </br>
So, tell me if you will:</br>
Am I guilty of being too picky?</br>
Or just of knowing exactly what I want?</br>
and what, may I ask,</br>
would be so wrong about that?</br>
