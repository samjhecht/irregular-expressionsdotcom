<div class="poem-wrapper">
  Where should I go while my heart still works?<br>
  I want to go for a drive with a redhead I just met<br>
  In her old Ford F-150 from the 70s,<br>
  and visit farms and dead end roads and just laugh.<br>
  And just feel the wind with the windows down<br>
  because the air conditioning doesn’t work. Of course.<br>
  <br>
  I want to rent a cabin in the woods<br>
  And just write.<br>
  But then realize the cabin was never the place.<br>
  That I needed to be near water.<br>
  And people.<br>
  So I go to the coast and find a town.<br>
  That has a bar.<br>
  And I just sit in that bar and write.<br>
  Until I’ve written something worth reading.<br>
  Wouldn’t that be fucking grand.<br>
  <br>
  I want to go to Ireland.<br>
  To somewhere southwest of Cork.<br>
  To a little pub where good people go<br>
  to drink good drinks and be drunk and be happy.<br>
  And I’d like to play music for the good people.  <br>
  And make almost nothing or just enough for board.<br>
  Either way, wouldn’t that be grand.<br>
  <br>
  I want to take a trip with the love of my life,<br>
  and not know it’s that way until the end,<br>
  when it all comes smashing down to reality<br>
  and I see just how powerful this life can be.<br>
  <br>
  I want to run with the bulls<br>
  and be gored but hopefully not die.<br>
  Dios mío! what a story!!!<br>
  And then spend a month on a righteous bender.<br>
  Making and losing beautiful memories<br>
  in the streets of Spain with the Spaniards.<br>
  You must know that would be grand?<br>
  <br>
  I want go deep. <br>
  Really plumb the depths of my soul.<br>
  I want to go deep enough to marry a mermaid.<br>
  And it could be true love!<br>
  Or maybe she’d rip my heart out<br>
  after the most amazing aquatic love affair?<br>
  It would still have been worth it.<br>
  Just imagine the songs I could write about it...<br>
  And finally be a musician worthy of calling himself a musician.<br>
  <br>
  Wow!! How great it feels!<br>
  Just to be alive.<br>
  Let’s hope tomorrow brings the same.<br>
  And if it doesn’t,<br>
  if instead we get the pits,<br>
  let’s hope we can remember<br>
  that we’ll be back up again.<br>
  That things can still be grand.<br>
