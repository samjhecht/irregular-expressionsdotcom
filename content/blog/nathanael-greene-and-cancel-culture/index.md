I was thinking more about Nathanael Greene and about how he got his statue ripped down in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn in 2020.  He was a hero of the American Revolutionary War and served until 1783, when he resigned his commission.  He had grown up in Rhode Island and spent his early life there prior to joining the military.  When he resigned from the military in 1783, he was left with a lot of debt and therefore decided to relocate to South Carolina to try and earn money running the slave plantations he had been awarded for his service during the war.  He did that for just two years before he died in 1786.  

The way he ended up in debt is interesting and potentially worth noting before ruling on whether to cancel him or not for the two years running slave plantations.  During the war he had trouble providing sufficient supplies for his men in the southern theater.  He got a loan from a bank but was required to personally sign his name to it.  So the loan taken to provide supplies for the continental army in the southern theater left him personally debt ridden after the war.   

It’s one thing to want to take down statues of Robert E. Lee.  He lived during a time where he would have been extensively exposed to opinions on why slavery was evil.  He weighed the concepts and then decided to lead the fight to protect the institution of slavery.   Fighting for a cause inextricably linked to the preservation of slavery was the pinnacle of his life’s work.  Putting up statues glorifying his role as a Confederate general is clearly problematic, especially when the statues were deliberately put up to glorify the pro-slavery cause during the Jim Crowe era.  

Greene, on the other hand, is memorialized for nothing to do with slavery.  It’s interesting to try to imagine what it would have been like to be Greene at the time when he decided to take ownership of slave plantations:
- You’ve spent your life in a time where the vast majority of the society around you was supportive of slavery (or at least not strongly against it).   You’ve largely only been exposed to a mono-culture.
- You’re riddled with debt after signing your own name to loans taken to provide for soldiers fighting in the American revolution.  You’re 42 years old (which was old in those days) and do not have a wide range of other lucrative options to pivot your career to.  You’ve just dedicated your entire career to the military up to that point.
