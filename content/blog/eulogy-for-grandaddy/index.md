**Note: I felt compelled to give a eulogy at my grandfather's funeral.  This poured out of me in about 45 minutes while crying in front of strangers on the flight back to VA.**


There is a fragment of a poem they found in one of the notebooks of the poet Raymond Carver.  It was written near the end of his life.  I think it’s beautiful and I’d like to share it with you now.  It’s in the form of a brief conversation and goes like this:

    And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so?  
    I did.  
    And what did you want?  
    To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.  

Julius Clay Morris was beloved by many.  One of the things I’m most thankful for is that I got the chance to tell him what he meant to me.  It was important to me that he feel himself beloved on this earth.  Over these last few days, however, I’ve come to realize that the word “beloved” is insufficient to characterize how I felt about him and what he meant to me.  He has been one of the single most influential people in my life and in making me the person I strive to be.  

On my flight back from California last night, I took some time to try and write down all of the things he taught me.  If you’ll humor me, I’d like to share some of them right now:

    <ul>
        <li>He taught me never to complain.  No matter how bad you feel.</li>
        <li>To always say “I’m just great” when someone asks how you’re doing. You just might believe it yourself and they don’t really want to hear about your problems anyway.</li>
        <li>To tough it out and keep going, even when you only have one good eye, one working set of shoulder tendons, and have survived cancer.</li>
        <li>How to shoot a gun. To handle one safely.  …and to not let the government take yours away from you ;).</li>
        <li>He taught me to treat all people fairly and to be honest (although I am pretty sure granddaddy might have lied to me when he told me he never smoked cigarettes despite growing up on a tobacco farm outside of Winston Salem).</li>
        <li>To be strong and firm but overwhelmingly kind.</li>
        <li>How to catch a catfish with your bare hands and how to catch a snake behind the head so it can’t bite you.</li>
        <li>How to gently catch bumblebees with your bare hands without being stung.  The man was a friend of the bees.  The fact that bees would never sting Julius Morris has always fascinated me. The best explanation I can come up with is that it must mean that even they recognized his quality over some wild animal dimension.</li>
        <li>How to drive stick and how to change the oil in my car.</li>
        <li>The difference between alternating and direct current and about how a transistor works.</li>
        <li>To have a passion for learning and for technology.</li>
        <li>To not be encumbered by the limits of your formal education. To be a life long learner without self imposed subject matter boundaries.</li>
        <li>To be a hard worker.   Slipping off to the barn to sneak in some work on an ongoing project while everyone else is napping or watching TV.</li>
        <li>To make lists.  Never ending todo lists.  You’ve got to stay busy.</li>
        <li>That I always had someone who was there for me in my youth.  A home where I was always welcome to come back to and be loved and cared for and where no explanations would ever be necessary.</li>
        <li>He taught me that family comes first.</li>
        <li>He taught me to be a patriot.</li>
        <li>Finally, he taught me to appreciate the opportunities I have.  Because not all that long ago, a man a lot younger than me, who only got to go to school til the second grade, built a house for his family with his own hands, adding a wall, a chimney or one more part of a roof with each paycheck that came in.  And then somehow managed to teach himself to be an electrical engineer and to build a thriving business from nothing.</li>

I doubt that I’ll ever be nearly as good as he was at conducting myself in accordance with the lessons and principles he taught me, but I know I’ll always aspire to. 

And one thing I can say with certainty is that something I’ll always be the most proud of is that my middle name is Julius.
